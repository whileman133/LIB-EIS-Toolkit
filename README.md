# EIS Toolkit for Lithium-Ion Battery Cells

This repository contains MATLAB and Python code for calculating battery impedance from PDAE models constructed in 
COMSOL Multiphysics and PyBaMM. Also 
provided is a closed-form transfer 
function (TF) model for evaluating the impedance of lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells from the lumped-parameter model specified by Plett and Trimboli.[^1]

## MATLAB Resources

MATLAB code is provided for calculating battery impedance from COMSOL models using two approaches: 
time-domain simulation (TD) and frequency-domain linear perturbation (LP).

# EIS Toolkit for Lithium-Ion Battery Cells

This repository contains MATLAB and Python code for calculating battery impedance from PDAE models constructed in 
COMSOL Multiphysics and PyBaMM. Two methods for computing impedance using COMSOL/PyBaMM models are provided: 
time-domain 
simulation 
(TD) 
and 
frequency-domain 
linear 
perturbation 
(LP). Also 
provided is a closed-form transfer 
function (TF) model for evaluating the impedance of lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells.

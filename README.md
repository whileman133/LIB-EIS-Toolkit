# EIS Toolkit for Lithium-Ion Battery Cells

This repository contains MATLAB and Python code for calculating battery impedance from PDAE models constructed in 
COMSOL Multiphysics and PyBaMM. Also 
provided is a closed-form transfer 
function (TF) model for evaluating the impedance of lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells.
